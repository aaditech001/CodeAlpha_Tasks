## 📌 Task 1: Unemployment Analysis During COVID-19

### 📖 Overview
This project analyzes unemployment trends in India during the COVID-19 period (2019–2020).  
The objective is to understand how unemployment rates changed over time, identify regional variations, and assess the economic impact of lockdown phases.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze unemployment trends before and during COVID-19  
- Compare region-wise and state-wise unemployment patterns  
- Visualize trends using plots and heatmaps  
- Derive insights to support policy and economic analysis  

### 🛠️ Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Time-series trend analysis  
- Data Visualization  

### 🔍 Key Insights
- Unemployment rose sharply during strict lockdown periods in 2020.  
- Urban areas experienced higher volatility compared to rural regions.  
- Significant variation was observed across states, indicating uneven economic impact.  
- Recovery patterns differed by region, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.

## 📌 Task 2: Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

### 📖 Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict product sales based on advertising budgets spent on TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels.  
The task is framed as a supervised regression problem.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Explore relationships between advertising spend and sales  
- Build baseline and advanced regression models  
- Compare models using cross-validation  
- Select the best-performing model and interpret results  

### 🛠️ Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & EDA  
- Linear Regression (Baseline Model)  
- Ridge & Lasso Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Cross-Validation & Model Evaluation  

### 📊 Final Model Performance
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Train R²:** 0.9967  
- **Test R²:** 0.9826  
- **MAE (Test):** 0.6131  
- **RMSE (Test):** 0.7403  

### 🔍 Key Insights
- TV advertising has the strongest impact on sales.  
- Radio has a moderate influence.  
- Newspaper advertising contributes minimally.  
- Random Forest effectively captures nonlinear relationships and outperforms linear models.
